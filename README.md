# Cryptography
An encryption application that allows you to safely encrypt and decrypt your message.

<hr>

### How to download and run the application?
#### Run through an installer:
(*There is no supported installer right now yet*)
#### Run with a zipped file:
* First, you need to have a Python IDE installed to run the application. You can download the IDE [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
* Then, you need to install `pip` (Python Package Installer). You can read the tutorial to download `pip` [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).<br>
* After that, you need to install these libraries: **[tkinter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-tkinter-in-python) (tk), [customtkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/), [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/), [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (Pillow)**.
```
pip install <library>
```

* After doing all the setup steps, this is how you can open and run the application file.
> 1. After downloading a `.rar` or `.zip` file, unzip it.
> 2. You will see a folder named **`cryptography`**. Open that folder.
> 3. After you do that, you should see a **`main.py`** file in that folder.
> 4. Open that **`main.py`** file. You will see a window and a black terminal.
> 5. The window you see is the application's main hub.
> 6. Click on the blue "Try it now" button and wait for the initialization.
> 7. After the initialization is finished, you suppose to see the main application window.
> 8. Start using it and enjoy! ❤️

**Note:** If you spot any error or bug, you should report it [here](https://github.com/ItsHungg/Cryptography/issues) immediately.

### FAQ (Frequently-Asked-Questions)
#### 1. Is Cryptography safe?
> Based on the code, I can be confident that Cryptography is safe and secure.
#### 2. An `AttributeError` error that would raise `_tkinter.TclError` and crash the program when I return to the main hub.
> The investigation to fix that error has begun. Currently, you need to run the file again and it should work perfectly.
