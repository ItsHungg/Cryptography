* After that, you need to install these libraries: **[tkinter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-tkinter-in-python) (tk), [customtkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/), [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/), [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (Pillow)**.
```
pip install <library>
```
